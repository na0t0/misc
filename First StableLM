Hello, could you give me a Powershell script could login remote pc via remote desktop?
Sure! Here’s a PowerShell script that will do the login to a remote Windows computer using Remote Desktop:

# Specify the remote computer name and credentials
$r = "YOUR_REMOTE_NAME_HERE"
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($r.User, $r.Password)

# Connect to the remote computer
Connect-Msol -Credential $cred

# Run PowerShell commands on the remote computer
(Get-Host).Name
Set-Location
(Write-Host "Logging in to remote computer...")
Start-Process -FilePath "msiexec.exe"
Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 1000
(Get-Childitem -Path \\$r\c$\windows\system32 -Filter *.dat).dat -recurse | Select-Object "Display Name")

Stop-Process -Force -Timeout 5
(Write-Host "Logging out of remote computer...")
Disconnect-Msol
Note that the Connect-Msol cmdlet is used to authenticate with the remote machine, and the Start-Process cmdlet is used to run PowerShell commands on the remote computer. The Get-Childitem -Path \\$r\c$\windows\system32 -Filter *.dat command retrieves the log file for the remote computer, which contains information about its current state and how it’s been configured.

The Write-Host cmdlet is used to display messages on the remote computer, and the Start-Process cmdlet is used to execute PowerShell commands on the remote computer. The Start-Sleep cmdlet is used to perform a “keep-alive” process on the remote computer when it’s not responsive, in order to avoid going to sleep without displaying progress. Finally, the Disconnect-Msol cmdlet is used to disconnect from the remote computer.
